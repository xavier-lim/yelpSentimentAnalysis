# Yelp Customer Sentiment Analysis
![Header](https://github.com/xavier-lim/yelpSentimentAnalysis/blob/main/images/yelp_Header.jpg)

This project consists of using natural language processing (NLP) to predict whether Yelp reviews are positive or negative based on keywords. I created a support vector machine (SVM) classifier model to make these predictions. This type of analysis is used to determine the general tone of customer reviews and to get a better understanding of a consumer's attitude towards a brand, product, or service.

## Data Source
All the data for this project was collected from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/matleonard/nlp-course). The data set presents 44530 Yelp reviews, accompanied by ratings (1 to 5 stars). However, I only utilized a subset of the data (5000 reviews) to reduce the amount of time required to run the model.

## Results
![Results](https://github.com/xavier-lim/yelpSentimentAnalysis/blob/main/images/Results.PNG)

My model correctly classified 95.2% of the reviews.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, my model successfully predicted whether most reviews were positive or negative. However, the model accuracy may slightly vary if a larger subset of reviews is extracted from the full dataset.
